Quotes from Marcus Aurelius

http://aurelius.co


## Would you like to help out by adding quotes?

I would love you have your help! So far, I've only transcribed my
favorite quotes, but there are many more Aurelius quotes that deserve
to be available.

The quotes are stored in `data/marcus.json`. The format is:

- the document is a list of quotes
- each quote is a JSON object
- the `"quote"` field contains a list of strings. Each string is a
  paragraph.
- the `"book"` and `"section"` fields are integers

To submit a quote, go to [`data/marcus.json`][data] and click the
pencil icon (next to the "Raw Blame History" buttons). Then type out
your quote in the format described above and submit a Pull Request. I
will review and merge your changes as soon as I can.

If you have any questions, [open an issue][newissue] and I will
respond ASAP.
